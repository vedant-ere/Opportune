# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files for the browser extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16×16 pixels
- `icon32.png` - 32×32 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48×48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128×128 pixels

## Creating Icons

### Option 1: Use an Online Generator

1. Go to https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Upload your logo or design
3. Download the generated icons
4. Rename them to match the required filenames above
5. Place them in this folder

### Option 2: Use a Design Tool

1. Create your design in Figma, Canva, or Photoshop
2. Export at each required size
3. Save as PNG format
4. Place in this folder

### Design Guidelines

- **Simple & Recognizable**: The icon should be clear even at 16×16 pixels
- **High Contrast**: Ensure it's visible on both light and dark backgrounds
- **Consistent Branding**: Match your application's color scheme
- **Square Format**: All icons should be square (equal width and height)

### Temporary Solution

The extension will work without custom icons (browser will use default icon), but for a professional look, create custom icons following the guidelines above.

### Recommended Design

For Opportune, consider:
- A clipboard or document icon
- The letter "O" in your brand colors
- A checkmark or target symbol
- Keep it minimal and modern

## Example Icon Sizes

```
icon16.png   →  16 × 16 pixels  (toolbar icon)

icon48.png   →  48 × 48 pixels  (extension management)
icon128.png  → 128 × 128 pixels (web store/installation)
```
